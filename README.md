Provides a basic file structure and uses the gulp build tasks of create-amp-page, with additionally: markdown and netlify cms.

- uses `.scss` files
- page data as `.json` and `.md` with frontmatter
- twig templates and pages
    - pages by template files in `src/html/pages`
    - pages with folders of frontmatter / collections
    - using page filename for
        - frontmatter files resolution
        - links generation (e.g. canonical)
- media optimizing for png, jpg, gif, svg
- markdown to HTML generation, preinstalled markdown-it plugins for extended syntax
- basic Twig template for AMP or none AMP pages
    - `ampEnabled = true` as template variable enables the needed AMP parts
    - HTML for AMP scripts
    - inline CSS parts for AMP, also where the CSS is injected by gulp task
    - `amp` attribute at `html` tag
- AMP Optimizer and removing unused CSS for production
- Headless Netlify CMS for site generation supported
    - uses also frontmatter
    - git repository management and netlify CI/CD
    - identity management by netlify, github and more
    - **easily removed** when not wanted:
        - delete `public/admin` folder and remove the netlify cms part in `src/html/_base.twig` block `foot_js`

## Default File Structure

- `build` dist folder after running `npm run build` or while `npm run start`
- `public` with general files in root like `manifest.json`
- `public/admin` config and setup files for netlify cms
- `src/api` may be used as mock api
- `src/data` contains the page frontmatter and data
- `src/html` is the base for all twig templates
- `src/html/pages` will be build to individual HTML pages
- `src/media` may contain images
- `src/styles/main.scss` is the style sheet

## Netlify CMS

This starter repository supports one click deployment on netlify, just [setup the needed identity handling](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/add-to-your-site/#authentication) for netlify CMS and you can start! The template files, scripts and content schemas are already configured.

You can edit your CMS content schemas in `public/admin/config.yml`.

As this is an AMP boilerplate and can't use netlifys JS login handling, the login is buggy: after login at `/admin` you will be redirected again to `/`, this triggers the login correctly (JWT exchange), but you will not be redirected to `/admin/` again. You currently need to add `/admin/` between domain and `#` after accepting an invite or logging in to finilize the action.

Take a look at the [authentication documentation for netlify cms](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/add-to-your-site/#authentication), and check how to [configure the cms](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/configuration-options/).

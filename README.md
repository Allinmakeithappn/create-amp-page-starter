Uses the default create-amp-page features and configures them with additional features.

- uses `.scss` files
- page data as `.json` and `.md` with frontmatter
- twig templates and pages
    - automatic pages by template files in `src/html/pages`
    - using page filename for
        - frontmatter files resolution
        - links generation (e.g. canonical)
- media optimizing for png, jpg, gif, svg
- markdown to HTML generation, preinstalled markdown-it plugins for extended syntax
- basic Twig template for AMP or none AMP pages
    - `ampEnabled = true` as template variable enables the needed AMP parts
    - HTML for AMP scripts
    - inline CSS parts for AMP, also where the CSS is injected by gulp task
    - `amp` attribute at `html` tag
- AMP Optimizer and removing unused CSS for production
- Headless Netlify CMS for site generation supported
    - uses also frontmatter
    - git repository management
    - identity management by netlify, github and more
    - **easily removed** when not wanted:
        - delete `admin` folder and remove the netlify cms part in `_base.twig` block `foot_js`

## Netlify CMS

This starter repository supports one-click deployment on netlify, just setup the needed identity handling for netlify CMS and you can start! The template files, scripts and contents are already configured.

You can edit your CMS content schemas in `public/admin/config.yml`.

As this is an AMP boilerplate, the login is buggy: after login at `/admin` you will be redirected again to `/`, this triggers the login correctly (JWT exchange), but you will not be redirected to `/admin/` again - as this would need forbidden JS in AMP.

Take a look at the [authentication documentation for netlify cms](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/add-to-your-site/#authentication), and check how to [configure the cms](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/configuration-options/).
